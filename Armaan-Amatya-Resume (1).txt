Work Experience
Algoverse
Aug 2025 – Nov 2025
Machine Learning Research Intern
Remote
• Collaborated with researchers from Stanford, Berkeley, and Vanderbilt on a scholarly paper exploring Large Language
Models (LLMs) and agentic capabilities
AI Agent Stealth Startup
May 2025 – Present
Fullstack AI Software Engineer
Remote
• Led the development of an agentic, AI-powered data analysis platform leveraging a multi-node LangGraph architecture
• Built a full-stack web application with a React 18 and TypeScript frontend using shadcn/ui, and an asynchronous
FastAPI backend with WebSocket support for real-time updates, Motor for non-blocking MongoDB access, and
MongoDB for storage and session persistence
